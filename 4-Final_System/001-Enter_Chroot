Setting up to build packages with pacman
Create a new user by adding the following to /etc/passwd:

arch:x:1000:1000:arch:/home/arch:/bin/bash

Where 1000 is the ID of the arch group. Check /etc/group for the correct ID, or if arch is not present in that file, add the following to it.

arch:x:1000:

Create a home directory:

mkdir -v /home/arch
chown -Rv arch:arch /home/arch

Exit your current chroot, then chroot into your new user (make sure 1000, 1000 and arch are set to the proper values for your system):

export CMLFS="/mnt1"

chroot --userspec=1000:1000 "$CMLFS" /llvmtools/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/home/arch \
    TERM="$TERM" \
    PS1='(cmlfs chroot) [\u@\h \W]\$ ' \
    PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/llvmtools/bin \
    LANG=zh_CN \
    /llvmtools/bin/bash --login +h
